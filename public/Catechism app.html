            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <p>This section will guide you through a prayerful review of your day.</p>
                <h3>I. What is an Examination of Conscience?</h3>
                <p>An <strong>examination of conscience</strong> is a prayerful self-reflection on our thoughts, words, deeds, and omissions, measured against God’s commandments and the teaching of the Church. Its purpose is to:</p>
                <ul>
            <li><strong>Recognize</strong> sins and faults honestly.</li>
            <li><strong>Acknowledge</strong> God’s mercy and our need for repentance.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare</strong> the soul to make a good Confession.</li>
            <li><strong>Form</strong> the conscience over time to be more sensitive to sin and more responsive to grace.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            “Examine yourselves, to see whether you are holding to your faith. Test yourselves.” — 2 Corinthians 13:5<br>
            “Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts!” — Psalm 139:23
        </blockquote>

        <h3>II. Why is it Important?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Confession</strong> — A good confession requires that we know and confess our mortal sins by kind and number, and it is helped by remembering venial sins as well.</li>
            <li><strong>For Growth in Holiness</strong> — Even outside of Confession, regular examination fosters humility, self-awareness, and a desire for virtue.</li>
            <li><strong>To Form the Conscience</strong> — By examining our lives in light of the Gospel, our conscience becomes better aligned with God’s will.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>III. When and How Often?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Before Confession</strong> — A thorough examination should be done before every sacramental confession.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily (Brief)</strong> — A short version at the end of the day, sometimes called an <em>examen</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Retreats or Spiritual Checkpoints</strong> — A deeper examination before retreats, spiritual direction, or big life decisions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>IV. Dispositions for a Good Examination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prayerful Attitude</strong> — Begin with prayer, asking the Holy Spirit for light and honesty.</li>
            <li><strong>Honesty</strong> — Avoid self-justification. Call sins what they are.</li>
            <li><strong>Hope in God’s Mercy</strong> — Avoid despair; focus on Christ’s saving love.</li>
            <li><strong>Resolve to Amend</strong> — A sincere desire to avoid sin and its occasions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>V. Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
        <h4>Step 1: Pray for Light</h4>
        <p>Ask the Holy Spirit to help you see yourself as God sees you.<br>
        <em>"Lord, help me to see my sins clearly and to know Your infinite mercy."</em></p>

        <h4>Step 2: Review Your Life</h4>
        <p>Use a framework such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Ten Commandments</li>
            <li>The Precepts of the Church</li>
            <li>The Beatitudes</li>
            <li>The Seven Deadly Sins</li>
            <li>Your State in Life Duties</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Examination by the Ten Commandments</h4>

        <h5>1. I am the Lord your God; you shall not have strange gods before Me.</h5>

            <li>Have I loved God above all things?</li>
            <li>Have I trusted in superstition, astrology, occult practices?</li>
            <li>Have I been faithful in prayer?</li>
            <li>Have I made idols of money, pleasure, or success?</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>3. Remember to keep holy the Lord’s Day.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Have I missed Mass on Sundays or Holy Days without serious reason?</li>
            <li>Have I been inattentive or distracted at Mass?</li>
            <li>Have I done unnecessary work instead of resting in God?</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>4. Honor your father and your mother.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Have I disrespected or disobeyed my parents?</li>
            <li>As a parent, have I failed to guide my children toward God?</li>
            <li>Have I failed in obedience to lawful authority?</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>5. You shall not kill.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Have I harbored hatred, resentment, or revenge?</li>
            <li>Have I injured someone physically or spiritually?</li>
            <li>Have I been reckless with my health or others’?</li>
            <li>Have I supported abortion, euthanasia, or assisted suicide?</li>
            <li>Have I engaged in gossip or detraction?</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>6. You shall not commit adultery.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Have I engaged in sexual activity outside marriage?</li>
            <li>Have I viewed pornography or entertained lustful thoughts?</li>
            <li>Have I been faithful to my spouse in thought and action?</li>
            <li>Have I respected the dignity of my own body and others’?</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>7. You shall not steal.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Have I taken what is not mine?</li>
            <li>Have I cheated in business, school, or games?</li>
            <li>Have I wasted time or resources?</li>
            <li>Have I failed in generosity?</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>8. You shall not bear false witness.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Have I lied or been deceitful?</li>
            <li>Have I spoken falsely about others?</li>
            <li>Have I withheld the truth when obligated to speak?</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>9. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Have I been envious of another’s spouse or relationship?</li>
            <li>Have I entertained impure desires?</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>10. You shall not covet your neighbor’s goods.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Have I been jealous of what others have?</li>
            <li>Have I been greedy or discontent?</li>
            <li>Have I trusted in possessions rather than God?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Step 3: Acknowledge Sins and Their Gravity</h4>
        <p><strong>Mortal Sin</strong> — Grave matter, full knowledge, and deliberate consent (CCC 1857–1859). Must be confessed in kind and number.<br>
        <strong>Venial Sin</strong> — Lesser matter or without full consent. Still worth confessing for spiritual growth.</p>

        <h4>Step 4: Make an Act of Contrition</h4>
        <p><em>O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended You, and I detest all my sins because of Your just punishments, but most of all because they offend You, my God, who are all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Your grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin. Amen.</em></p>

        <h3>VI. Tips for a Fruitful Examination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep a spiritual journal to note recurring sins and patterns.</li>
            <li>Regularly read Scripture and the Catechism to form your conscience.</li>
            <li>Ask a trusted confessor for guidance.</li>
            <li>Let the examination lead to gratitude for God’s mercy, not scrupulosity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>VII. Quick Daily Mini-Examen (5 minutes)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place yourself in God’s presence.</li>
            <li>Thank Him for the day’s blessings.</li>
            <li>Ask the Holy Spirit for light.</li>
            <li>Review the day briefly — thoughts, words, deeds, omissions.</li>
            <li>Express sorrow, make a resolution, and pray an Act of Contrition.</li>
        </ol>

        title: "What is Faith?",
        content: `
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and all that He has revealed, and that Holy Church proposes for our belief, because He is truth itself (CCC 1814).</p>

            <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hebrews 11:1</strong> – "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."</li>
                <li><strong>Romans 10:17</strong> – "So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ."</li>
                <li><strong>John 20:29</strong> – "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</li>
                <li><strong>Ephesians 2:8–9</strong> – "For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Catechism References</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CCC 26</strong> – Faith is man’s response to God, who reveals himself and gives himself to man.</li>
                <li><strong>CCC 142–143</strong> – By faith, man completely submits his intellect and will to God.</li>
                <li><strong>CCC 1814</strong> – Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and all He has revealed.</li>
                <li><strong>CCC 1842</strong> – Faith, hope, and charity are the theological virtues given to us by God.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Proclamation</h3>
            <blockquote>
                "Without faith, it is impossible to please God" (Hebrews 11:6). Faith is the foundation of the Christian life, the key by which we open the door to grace. Through faith, we say 'yes' to God’s invitation and enter into a relationship of trust, obedience, and love.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>Faith is both a gift from God and a human act. As a gift, faith is infused into the soul at Baptism by the Holy Spirit, enabling us to believe in divine truth beyond the capacity of reason alone. As a human act, faith is our free response to God’s self-revelation, expressed in trust, obedience, and worship.</p>
            <p>Faith is not a blind leap, but a reasoned trust in the One who is Truth itself. It engages both intellect and will: the intellect assents to God’s revealed truth, and the will commits to living according to that truth. Faith is strengthened by prayer, the sacraments, and living in communion with the Church. It must be lived out through works of love (cf. James 2:14–17), for faith without works is dead.</p>
            <p>The Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, safeguards and transmits the faith through Scripture and Tradition. In professing the Creed, we publicly affirm our faith, uniting ourselves to the Body of Christ throughout the world and across history.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Divine Revelation is God’s free and loving act of making Himself and His plan of salvation known to humanity, culminating in the person and mission of Jesus Christ (CCC 50).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hebrews 1:1–2</strong> – "In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son."</li>
            <li><strong>John 1:14</strong> – "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth."</li>
            <li><strong>1 John 1:1–2</strong> – "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, seen with our eyes, and touched with our hands... we proclaim to you the eternal life."</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 11:27</strong> – "No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 50</strong> – By natural reason man can know God from His works, but there is another order of knowledge which man cannot possibly arrive at by his own powers: the order of divine Revelation.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 51</strong> – It pleased God, in His goodness and wisdom, to reveal Himself and to make known the mystery of His will.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 65</strong> – In His Son, God has said everything; there will be no new public Revelation before the glorious manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 74</strong> – God desires all to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth, therefore Christ must be proclaimed to all nations and individuals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "In Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God made man, God has fully and definitively revealed Himself. There is no greater message, no deeper truth, and no more perfect love than the Word made flesh dwelling among us."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Divine Revelation is God’s initiative to make Himself known to us, not because He needed to, but because He desired to share His divine life and love. While human reason can discover certain truths about God through creation, only Revelation unveils the fullness of who God is and His plan for salvation.</p>
        <p>This Revelation took place gradually. In the Old Testament, God revealed Himself through creation, covenants, the Law, and the prophets. In the New Testament, He revealed Himself fully and perfectly in His Son, Jesus Christ, who is the visible image of the invisible God (Colossians 1:15). In Christ, God’s word is definitive and complete.</p>
        <p>The content of Divine Revelation is preserved and transmitted through Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition, interpreted authentically by the Magisterium of the Church. This ensures that the faith we profess today is the same faith handed down from the apostles. Revelation is not merely information about God—it is a personal invitation into communion with Him, calling for a response of faith and obedience.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Sacred Scripture, or the Holy Bible, is the inspired Word of God, written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and faithfully preserved by the Church. It reveals God’s plan for salvation and teaches truth without error for the sake of our salvation (cf. CCC 107).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 Timothy 3:16–17</strong> – "All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness."</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 119:105</strong> – "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."</li>
            <li><strong>John 20:31</strong> – "These are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name."</li>
            <li><strong>Hebrews 4:12</strong> – "The word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 101</strong> – In Sacred Scripture, the Church constantly finds her nourishment and her strength.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 105</strong> – God is the author of Sacred Scripture; He inspired its human authors.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 107</strong> – Scripture teaches the truth without error for the sake of our salvation.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 108</strong> – The Christian faith is not a “religion of the book,” but of the Word of God incarnate and living.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The Bible is not merely a record of ancient events; it is the living Word of God, through which the Lord Himself speaks to His people today."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Sacred Scripture is one of the two modes through which Divine Revelation is transmitted, the other being Sacred Tradition. Composed of the Old and New Testaments, it records God’s progressive self-revelation, culminating in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Though written by human authors, every book of Scripture is inspired by the Holy Spirit, making God the true author.</p>
        <p>The Scriptures are “without error” (inerrant) in what they teach for the sake of salvation. This does not mean they are a scientific or historical textbook, but that they faithfully convey divine truth. The Old Testament prepares for the New, and the New fulfills the Old, together forming a unified whole (cf. CCC 128–130).</p>
        <p>The Church has the responsibility and authority to authentically interpret Scripture, ensuring the faithful understand it as intended by God. Catholics are encouraged to read and meditate on the Bible regularly, allowing it to guide their faith, morals, and daily living.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Sacred Tradition is the living transmission of the message of the Gospel in the Church. It was handed on from Christ to the Apostles and their successors, guided by the Holy Spirit, and preserved through the teaching, life, and worship of the Church (CCC 78).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 Thessalonians 2:15</strong> – "Stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by letter."</li>
            <li><strong>1 Corinthians 11:2</strong> – "Maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you."</li>
            <li><strong>John 21:25</strong> – "There are also many other things that Jesus did; were every one of them to be written, I suppose the world itself could not contain the books."</li>
            <li><strong>Acts 2:42</strong> – "They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 74</strong> – The Apostles handed on what they had received from Christ’s teaching and example.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 76</strong> – In keeping with the Lord’s command, the Gospel was handed on orally and in writing.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 78</strong> – Sacred Tradition is the living transmission of the Gospel, distinct from but closely connected with Sacred Scripture.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 81–82</strong> – Scripture and Tradition together form the one deposit of faith entrusted to the Church.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 85</strong> – The task of interpreting the Word of God authentically has been entrusted solely to the Magisterium of the Church.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The same Holy Spirit who inspired the Scriptures guides the living Tradition of the Church, ensuring that the Gospel is faithfully handed on until the end of time."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Sacred Tradition is not merely human customs or church practices; it is the divinely guided transmission of God’s Revelation, entrusted by Christ to His Apostles. Along with Sacred Scripture, it forms a single sacred deposit of the Word of God, which the Church guards and interprets.</p>
        <p>This Tradition includes teachings and practices that may not be explicitly found in Scripture but are rooted in the life and mission of Christ and the Apostles. It is passed on through liturgy, preaching, writings of the Fathers, ecumenical councils, and the lived faith of the Church.</p>
        <p>The Magisterium — the Pope and bishops in communion with him — has the responsibility of authentically interpreting both Scripture and Tradition. This ensures the faithful receive the same Gospel truth handed down from the beginning, safeguarded from error by the Holy Spirit.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Creeds are concise, authoritative summaries of the Christian faith, professed by the Church and rooted in Sacred Scripture and Tradition. Ecumenical Councils are official gatherings of the bishops of the world, in communion with the Pope, that clarify and define matters of faith and morals under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matthew 16:16–18</strong> – Peter’s profession: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</li>
            <li><strong>1 Corinthians 15:3–5</strong> – Paul summarizes the Gospel he received and handed on.</li>
            <li><strong>Acts 15:6–29</strong> – The Council of Jerusalem resolves a doctrinal dispute in the early Church.</li>
            <li><strong>Ephesians 4:4–6</strong> – "One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 185–187</strong> – The Creeds summarize the essential elements of the faith.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 192–197</strong> – The Apostles’ and Nicene Creeds as ancient symbols of faith.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 849, 888–892</strong> – The teaching authority of the Church and the role of councils.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 884</strong> – Ecumenical councils bring together bishops to exercise authority over the universal Church.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The Creeds unite us in the one faith of the Church, while the Councils safeguard that faith against error and proclaim it with clarity for every generation."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Creeds, such as the Apostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creed, are concise statements of the essential truths of Christianity. They developed in the Church’s early centuries as a way to instruct believers, guard against false teachings, and provide a common profession of faith during liturgy. The Creeds are not human inventions but authoritative formulations of the faith handed down from the Apostles and rooted in Scripture.</p>
        <p>Ecumenical Councils are solemn assemblies of bishops, in communion with the Pope, convened to address doctrinal, moral, or disciplinary issues affecting the universal Church. Guided by the Holy Spirit, they clarify teachings, condemn heresies, and promote unity. Historic examples include the Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325), which affirmed Christ’s divinity and produced the original Nicene Creed, and the Council of Trent (1545–1563), which addressed the challenges of the Protestant Reformation.</p>
        <p>Creeds and Councils together serve as instruments through which the Church preserves, explains, and hands on the one faith, ensuring that all believers share in the same truth proclaimed by Christ and His Apostles.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>God the Father is the first Person of the Holy Trinity, the Almighty Creator of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. He is the source of all life, the origin of creation, and the loving Father who sustains and governs all that exists (CCC 198–199).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genesis 1:1</strong> – "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</li>

            <li><strong>Matthew 6:9</strong> – "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."</li>
            <li><strong>1 Corinthians 8:6</strong> – "For us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 198</strong> – Our profession of faith begins with God because God is the first and the last.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 199</strong> – "I believe in God" is the most fundamental affirmation of the Creed.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 279</strong> – "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" is the first, solemn affirmation of the Creed.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 290</strong> – Creation is the common work of the Holy Trinity, but is particularly attributed to the Father.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 295</strong> – God creates by wisdom and love.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "God the Father is not a distant architect of the universe, but the loving Creator and sustainer of all that exists, who calls each of us into a relationship of trust, obedience, and love."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Creed begins with the confession of faith in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. This affirms that all things—both visible (material creation) and invisible (spiritual realities like angels)—come from Him. As the first Person of the Trinity, the Father is the eternal source, from whom the Son is begotten and the Holy Spirit proceeds.</p>
        <p>God creates freely and out of love, not from necessity or pre-existing matter. His creation is ordered, good, and purposeful, revealing His wisdom and glory. Far from abandoning His creation, the Father continues to sustain and guide it toward its ultimate fulfillment in Christ.</p>
        <p>To call God "Father" is to acknowledge Him as both the Creator of all and the One who adopts us as His children in Christ. Through Baptism, we become sons and daughters of the Father, destined to share eternal life with Him.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Blessed Trinity is the central mystery of the Christian faith and life: one God in three divine Persons — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — who are distinct from one another yet equal in divinity, sharing the same nature, essence, and will (CCC 253–255).</p>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the source of all the other mysteries of faith, the light that illuminates them all."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The doctrine of the Blessed Trinity teaches that there is one God in three divine Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. They are distinct in relation to one another — the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Spirit, and the Spirit is not the Father — yet each is fully God, co-eternal and co-equal, possessing the fullness of the divine essence.</p>
        <p>The Father eternally begets the Son; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son. This mystery, revealed by Jesus Christ and understood in faith, is beyond human reason but not contrary to it.</p>
        <p>The Trinity is reflected in the Church’s prayer and life: in baptism, in the Eucharistic liturgy, and in every blessing. To live the Christian life is to enter into the communion of love that exists eternally between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a communion we are invited to share through grace.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God who became man for our salvation. Conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, He entered into human history to reveal the fullness of God’s truth and to reconcile humanity with the Father. His incarnation unites the divine and human natures in one Person, without confusion or separation.</p>
        <p>Through His preaching, miracles, and example, Jesus revealed the Kingdom of God and invited all people to repentance and faith. His passion and death on the cross were the ultimate act of love, offered for the forgiveness of sins. By rising from the dead, He conquered sin and death, opening the way to eternal life for all who believe.</p>
        <p>Jesus Christ is not merely a great teacher or prophet; He is God in the flesh, the Lord and Savior of the world. To confess Jesus as Lord is to commit one’s life to Him in faith, obedience, and love, and to proclaim Him to the world.</p>

        <p>The Incarnation is the mystery by which the eternal Son of God, without ceasing to be God, took on a human nature and became man in the person of Jesus Christ. He is true God and true man, fully united in one divine Person (CCC 461–463, 464).</p>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "In the Incarnation, the eternal God entered human history, so that by becoming what we are, He might make us share in what He is."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Incarnation is the central event of salvation history: God became man in Jesus Christ. Without ceasing to be fully divine, the Son of God assumed a complete human nature — body and soul — in order to redeem us from sin and bring us into union with God.</p>
        <p>Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary and was born into the human family, experiencing hunger, fatigue, joy, sorrow, and even death. His divinity and humanity are perfectly united in the hypostatic union, meaning that in the one Person of Christ, the divine and human natures exist without confusion, change, division, or separation.</p>
        <p>The Incarnation reveals God’s profound love: He comes to us not as a distant ruler, but as Emmanuel — "God with us." Through His humanity, Jesus becomes the perfect mediator, bridging the gap between God and man, and showing us the fullness of truth and love.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ — known as the Paschal Mystery — is the central event of salvation history. Through His earthly life and ministry, His sacrificial death on the cross, and His glorious resurrection, Jesus accomplished our redemption and opened the way to eternal life (CCC 571–655).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mark 10:45</strong> – "The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</li>
            <li><strong>John 19:30</strong> – "It is finished." (Jesus’ final words on the cross)</li>
            <li><strong>Luke 24:6–7</strong> – "He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you… that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified, and on the third day rise."</li>
            <li><strong>1 Corinthians 15:3–4</strong> – "Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures… he was buried… he was raised on the third day."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 571</strong> – The Paschal Mystery of Christ’s cross and resurrection stands at the center of the Good News.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 601</strong> – Jesus’ death was part of God’s plan of salvation.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 613</strong> – Christ’s death is the unique sacrifice that accomplishes our redemption.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 638</strong> – The resurrection of Jesus is the crowning truth of our faith in Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 655</strong> – The resurrection is the source of our future resurrection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "By His life, Christ reveals the Father; by His death, He redeems us; and by His resurrection, He opens the way to eternal life."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Jesus’ earthly life reveals the Father’s love and truth. Through His teachings, miracles, and compassion for the poor and sinners, He proclaimed the Kingdom of God and invited all to repentance and faith.</p>
        <p>His death on the cross was the supreme act of love, offered for the forgiveness of our sins. Far from being a tragic accident, it was the fulfillment of God’s plan for salvation, foretold in Scripture and freely embraced by Jesus in obedience to the Father’s will.</p>
        <p>The resurrection of Jesus on the third day is the definitive proof of His divinity and the victory over sin and death. It confirms all that He taught and accomplished, and it guarantees our own future resurrection if we remain united to Him.</p>
        <p>The Paschal Mystery is made present to us in the liturgy, especially in the celebration of the Eucharist, where we participate in Christ’s sacrifice and share in the power of His resurrection.</p>

        <p>The Ascension of Jesus Christ is the event, forty days after His resurrection, when He was taken up body and soul into heaven and seated at the right hand of the Father. It marks the completion of His earthly mission and the beginning of His reign as Lord of heaven and earth (CCC 659–667).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Luke 24:50–51</strong> – "While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven."</li>

            <li><strong>John 14:2–3</strong> – "I go to prepare a place for you… I will come again and will take you to myself."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 659</strong> – Jesus’ body is glorified after the resurrection and definitively enters God’s heavenly domain.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 661</strong> – The Ascension marks the irreversible entry of Christ’s humanity into divine glory.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 663</strong> – Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father, signifying His reign and priestly intercession.</li>

            "The Ascension is not Christ’s departure from us, but His exaltation to the Father’s glory, where He reigns as Lord and intercedes for His Church."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Ascension took place forty days after the resurrection, witnessed by the apostles. Jesus, in His glorified body, was taken into heaven and seated at the right hand of the Father. This is not merely a change of location but the completion of His mission on earth and the beginning of His reign in glory.</p>
        <p>Seated at the Father’s right hand, Jesus exercises His kingship over heaven and earth, and serves as our eternal High Priest, interceding for us before the Father. The Ascension also prepared the way for the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, empowering the Church for its mission.</p>
        <p>The Ascension assures believers that Christ has gone ahead to prepare a place for us and that we too are called to share in His glory. It also reminds us of His promise to return at the end of time to judge the living and the dead.</p>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The Holy Spirit is the soul of the Church, guiding her into all truth, empowering her mission, and making us sharers in the divine life."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Blessed Trinity, eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son. He is equal in divinity and glory with the Father and the Son. In creation, He brought order and life; in the Old Testament, He spoke through the prophets; and in the fullness of time, He was sent by the Father and the Son to dwell in the hearts of believers.</p>
        <p>At Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles, filling them with power and courage to proclaim the Gospel. Since then, He continues to be present in the Church — in her sacraments, her teaching, her prayer, and the spiritual gifts given to believers for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
        <p>The Holy Spirit sanctifies the faithful, convicts the world of sin, and leads the Church into all truth. By His indwelling, Christians become temples of the Holy Spirit and are empowered to live holy lives and carry out the mission of Christ.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Creation is the free act by which God brought everything that exists—both visible and invisible—into being from nothing, out of His wisdom and love, for His glory and our good (CCC 279–324).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genesis 1:1</strong> – "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 33:6</strong> – "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host."</li>
            <li><strong>John 1:3</strong> – "All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made."</li>
            <li><strong>Colossians 1:16</strong> – "For in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 279</strong> – "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" is the first, solemn affirmation of the Creed.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 296</strong> – God created the world from nothing.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 299</strong> – Creation is ordered and good, reflecting the wisdom and goodness of the Creator.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 301</strong> – God upholds and sustains creation at every moment.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 319</strong> – God created everything for His glory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Creation is the first sign of God’s love, the stage upon which the drama of salvation unfolds, and the gift in which we discover our Creator."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The doctrine of creation teaches that God alone is the source of all that exists. He brought the universe into being freely, out of nothing (ex nihilo), motivated by His wisdom and love, not by necessity. Creation includes both the material world and the spiritual realm of angels and souls.</p>
        <p>Everything God created is good and ordered toward its proper purpose. Humanity, made in God’s image and likeness, holds a unique place in creation as stewards of the earth and as beings capable of knowing and loving the Creator.</p>
        <p>God’s creative work did not end in the beginning; He continually sustains and governs all things. Creation is the foundation for our relationship with God, as it reveals His majesty, power, and love, calling forth our worship and gratitude.</p>
        <p>Understanding creation shapes our worldview, reminding us of the dignity of all life, the importance of caring for the environment, and the call to live in harmony with God’s plan.</p>

        <p>Mankind is the summit of God’s visible creation, made in His image and likeness. The human person is a unity of body and soul, endowed with reason, free will, and an immortal destiny, called to share in God’s life and love (CCC 355–373).</p>

            <li><strong>CCC 373</strong> – Man was created in a state of original holiness and justice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Created in the image of God, every human person has inherent dignity, a rational soul, and an eternal destiny in communion with the Creator."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The human person is the only creature on earth that God willed for its own sake. Made in His image and likeness, man reflects God’s own nature through intellect, will, and the capacity for love. This likeness is not merely physical but spiritual, rooted in our rational soul and our call to live in communion with God.</p>
        <p>Man is a unity of body and soul. The body shares in the dignity of the image of God, and the soul, created directly by God, is spiritual and immortal. At death, the soul is separated from the body, but will be reunited with it in the resurrection at the end of time.</p>
        <p>Human dignity comes from our origin (created by God), our nature (rational and free), and our destiny (eternal life with God). This dignity demands that every person be treated with respect and love, regardless of age, ability, or condition.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, man was created in original holiness and justice, living in harmony with God, with others, and with creation. Sin disrupted this harmony, but through Christ, the perfect man, we are restored to friendship with God and offered eternal life.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Fall refers to the first sin of Adam and Eve, by which they disobeyed God’s command and lost the original holiness and justice in which they were created. Sin is an offense against God, a rupture of communion with Him, and a wound to human nature (CCC 396–412, 1849–1851).</p>

        <ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Through the disobedience of one man, sin entered the world, but through the obedience of Jesus Christ, grace and life abound for all."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Fall occurred when Adam and Eve, tempted by Satan in the form of a serpent, chose to disobey God’s direct command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This act was rooted in pride, distrust of God, and a desire to be “like God” apart from Him.</p>
        <p>As a result, they lost the original holiness and justice in which they were created, bringing suffering, death, and a wounded human nature into the world. This first sin, known as Original Sin, is transmitted to all human beings, except the Blessed Virgin Mary, who was preserved from it by a singular grace.</p>
        <p>Sin is more than breaking a rule; it is a rupture of relationship with God, others, and oneself. All personal sins weaken our communion with God, but mortal sin destroys it entirely, requiring repentance and reconciliation.</p>
        <p>The good news is that God did not abandon humanity. Immediately after the Fall, He promised a Redeemer in the Protoevangelium (Genesis 3:15), fulfilled in Jesus Christ, whose obedience, death, and resurrection restore us to grace.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Salvation History begins with creation, where God made humanity to live in communion with Him. After the Fall, God promised redemption and began unfolding His plan through covenants, prophets, and saving acts in history.</p>
        <p>This plan includes key moments: the covenant with Noah, the calling of Abraham, the liberation of Israel from Egypt under Moses, the giving of the Law, the kingdom established under David, and the messages of the prophets who called Israel back to faithfulness.</p>
        <p>All these events point toward and are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God. In His life, death, and resurrection, the fullness of God’s saving plan is revealed and accomplished. The Church, empowered by the Holy Spirit, now carries this message to the world until Christ returns in glory.</p>
        <p>Understanding Salvation History helps us see that God’s actions are not random but part of a coherent, loving plan that continues to unfold in our own lives today.</p>

            "By His cross and resurrection, Jesus Christ has destroyed death and restored life — the Paschal Mystery is the heart of our salvation."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The term “Paschal” comes from the Hebrew word “Pesach” (Passover). Just as the blood of the lamb saved the Israelites in Egypt, so the blood of Christ, the true Lamb of God, saves us from sin and eternal death.</p>
        <p>The Paschal Mystery includes four inseparable events: Christ’s passion (His suffering for our sins), His death on the cross (the perfect sacrifice for redemption), His resurrection (the victory over sin and death), and His ascension (His glorification at the right hand of the Father).</p>
        <p>This mystery is not only a past event — it is made present in the liturgy, especially the Eucharist, where we participate in the one sacrifice of Christ. Through baptism, we are united to Christ’s death and resurrection, called to die to sin and live for God.</p>
        <p>The Paschal Mystery reveals the depth of God’s love, the seriousness of sin, and the hope of eternal life. It is the foundation of Christian life and worship, shaping how we live and how we hope to die — in union with Christ.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Church is the People of God, the Body of Christ, and the Temple of the Holy Spirit. As the Body of Christ, the Church is united to Him as its Head, and her members are joined together in one faith, one baptism, and one mission (CCC 787–796).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 Corinthians 12:12–13</strong> – "For just as the body is one and has many members… so it is with Christ."</li>
            <li><strong>Ephesians 1:22–23</strong> – God "put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, which is his body."</li>
            <li><strong>Romans 12:4–5</strong> – "We, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another."</li>
            <li><strong>Colossians 1:18</strong> – "He is the head of the body, the church."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 787</strong> – Jesus spoke of a communion between Himself and those who follow Him.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 790</strong> – Believers become members of Christ’s Body through baptism.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 791</strong> – The unity of the Mystical Body overcomes human divisions.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 795</strong> – Christ and His Church form the whole Christ (Christus Totus).</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 796</strong> – The unity between Christ and the Church is like that of a bride and bridegroom.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The Church is not merely an institution but the living Body of Christ, in which every member is joined to Him and to one another in love."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The image of the Church as the Body of Christ emphasizes the deep unity between Christ and the faithful. Jesus is the Head, guiding, nourishing, and giving life to His members through the Holy Spirit. Through baptism, we are incorporated into this Body and made part of God’s family.</p>
        <p>Each member of the Body has unique gifts and roles, yet all work together for the building up of the Church and the mission of evangelization. When one member suffers, all suffer; when one rejoices, all share in the joy.</p>
        <p>The unity of the Body transcends all divisions of race, culture, and social status. In the Eucharist, the members are most fully united to Christ and to each other, forming one spiritual body.</p>
        <p>This unity is not merely symbolic — it is a real, mystical communion, in which Christ and His Church form one reality: the “whole Christ” (Christus Totus). This communion is a foretaste of the perfect unity we will share with God in heaven.</p>

        <p>The Four Marks of the Church — One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic — are the essential and visible characteristics of Christ’s Church, professed in the Nicene Creed. They identify the true Church founded by Jesus and continue to distinguish her throughout history (CCC 811–870).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>John 17:21</strong> – Jesus prays "that they may all be one."</li>
            <li><strong>Ephesians 4:4–6</strong> – "One body and one Spirit… one Lord, one faith, one baptism."</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 28:19–20</strong> – The Church’s mission to make disciples of all nations.</li>
            <li><strong>John 20:21</strong> – "As the Father has sent me, even so I send you."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 811</strong> – The four marks are inseparably linked and indicate the Church’s essential features.</li>

            <li><strong>CCC 823</strong> – The Church is holy because Christ, her head, is holy.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 830</strong> – The Church is catholic because she has the fullness of Christ’s truth and mission.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 857</strong> – The Church is apostolic because she is built on the foundation of the Apostles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The Church Christ founded is one, holy, catholic, and apostolic — marks that reveal her true identity and mission in the world."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Church is <strong>One</strong> because she has one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and is united in charity under the authority of the successors of the Apostles, especially the Pope as the successor of Peter.</p>
        <p>The Church is <strong>Holy</strong> because her founder, Jesus Christ, is holy; her purpose is to make people holy; and the Holy Spirit dwells within her, guiding and sanctifying her members, even though they are sinners.</p>
        <p>The Church is <strong>Catholic</strong> ("universal") because she possesses the fullness of Christ’s truth and means of salvation, and she is sent to all peoples, places, and cultures.</p>
        <p>The Church is <strong>Apostolic</strong> because she was founded on the Apostles, faithfully teaches their doctrine, and is led by their successors — the bishops in communion with the Pope.</p>
        <p>These four marks are signs of the true Church. They are not merely ideals but realities sustained by the Holy Spirit, ensuring that the Church remains faithful to Christ’s mission until the end of time.</p>

    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Communion of Saints is the spiritual union of all members of the Church — those on earth, the souls in purgatory, and the saints in heaven — united in Christ and sharing in the spiritual goods of the Church (CCC 946–962).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hebrews 12:1</strong> – "We are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses."</li>
            <li><strong>1 Corinthians 12:26–27</strong> – "If one member suffers, all suffer together… you are the body of Christ and individually members of it."</li>
            <li><strong>Revelation 5:8</strong> – The saints in heaven offer the prayers of the holy ones before God.</li>
            <li><strong>Ephesians 4:4</strong> – "There is one body and one Spirit."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 946</strong> – The communion of saints is the Church.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 948</strong> – This communion has two meanings: the communion in holy things and among holy persons.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 954</strong> – The three states of the Church: pilgrims on earth, souls in purgatory, and saints in heaven.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 957</strong> – Our communion with the saints joins heaven and earth.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 961</strong> – We are all one family in Christ, sharing in spiritual goods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "In Christ, the faithful on earth, the souls in purgatory, and the saints in heaven are united in one family of God, interceding for one another and sharing in God’s grace."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Communion of Saints refers to the deep spiritual bond that unites all members of the Church across time and space. It includes the Church militant (those living on earth), the Church suffering (souls in purgatory being purified), and the Church triumphant (the saints in heaven).</p>
        <p>This communion means we share in the spiritual goods of the Church: the sacraments, faith, the gifts of the Spirit, and the benefits of prayer. The saints in heaven intercede for us, the faithful on earth pray for one another and for the souls in purgatory, and those in purgatory can be helped by our prayers and sacrifices.</p>
        <p>Because we are all members of the one Body of Christ, the holiness of one benefits all, and the prayers of one strengthen the whole Church. This unity reflects the eternal communion we are called to share fully in heaven.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Blessed Virgin Mary is the Mother of God (Theotokos), conceived without Original Sin, ever-virgin, and assumed body and soul into heavenly glory. She is the first disciple of Christ, the model of faith and obedience, and the spiritual mother of all Christians (CCC 487–507, 963–975).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Luke 1:28</strong> – "Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you."</li>
            <li><strong>Luke 1:38</strong> – "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word."</li>
            <li><strong>John 19:26–27</strong> – Jesus entrusts Mary to the beloved disciple: "Behold, your mother."</li>
            <li><strong>Revelation 12:1</strong> – The vision of the woman clothed with the sun.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 487</strong> – What the Catholic faith believes about Mary is based on what it believes about Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 490</strong> – From the first moment of her conception, Mary was preserved immune from Original Sin (Immaculate Conception).</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 495</strong> – Mary is truly the Mother of God, since she is the mother of the eternal Son of God made man.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 499</strong> – Mary remained a virgin before, during, and after the birth of Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 966</strong> – At the end of her earthly life, Mary was assumed into heaven body and soul.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Mary is the first and perfect disciple of Christ, whose 'yes' brought the Savior into the world, and who now intercedes for us as our spiritual mother."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Mary’s role in salvation history is unique. Chosen from all eternity to be the Mother of the Redeemer, she freely consented to God’s plan at the Annunciation, making her the model of faith and obedience for all believers.</p>
        <p>By a singular grace (the Immaculate Conception), Mary was preserved from Original Sin from the first moment of her existence, preparing her to bear the Son of God. She is truly the Mother of God because the child she bore is the eternal Son made man.</p>
        <p>Mary remained ever-virgin — before, during, and after the birth of Jesus — a sign of her total dedication to God. At the end of her life, she was assumed body and soul into heaven, where she now shares fully in her Son’s glory and intercedes for us as our advocate.</p>
        <p>Honoring Mary does not detract from Christ but leads us closer to Him, for all Marian devotion is rooted in her role in God’s plan of salvation and her perfect discipleship.</p>

            "The angels, servants and messengers of God, protect us, guide us, and lead us toward eternal life."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Angels are purely spiritual beings created by God before the visible world. They are immortal and possess superior intelligence and will compared to humans. Their primary role is to worship and glorify God, serve as His messengers, and assist in carrying out His divine will.</p>
        <p>Some angels, led by Lucifer, freely chose to reject God, becoming demons. The good angels remained faithful and now assist in God’s plan of salvation. They guard individuals, guide nations, protect the Church, and act as instruments of God’s justice and mercy.</p>
        <p>Each person is assigned a guardian angel to protect and intercede for them. Angels are present in Scripture from Genesis to Revelation, appearing at key moments in salvation history, from the announcement of Christ’s birth to the final judgment.</p>
        <p>Their presence reminds us that the visible world is only part of God’s creation and that we are part of a greater spiritual reality.</p>

    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Last Four Things are the final realities each person will face: Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell. They remind us of the ultimate purpose of life — to live in union with God forever — and call us to conversion, holiness, and perseverance in faith (CCC 1020–1060).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hebrews 9:27</strong> – "It is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment."</li>
            <li><strong>2 Corinthians 5:10</strong> – "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ."</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 25:46</strong> – "They will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."</li>
            <li><strong>John 14:2–3</strong> – "I go to prepare a place for you… I will come again and take you to myself."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1021</strong> – Death ends human life as the time open to accepting or rejecting God’s grace.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1022</strong> – Each person receives their eternal retribution in their soul at the moment of death (Particular Judgment).</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1023</strong> – Heaven is the blessed communion with the Trinity, the angels, and all the saints.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1033</strong> – Hell is eternal separation from God.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1038–1041</strong> – The Last Judgment will reveal the ultimate meaning of all deeds and God’s justice and mercy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Remember your last end, and you will never sin. The Last Four Things remind us to live each day in light of eternity."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p><strong>Death:</strong> The separation of the soul from the body, marking the end of our earthly journey. Death entered the world through sin, but in Christ it becomes a passage to eternal life for those who believe.</p>
        <p><strong>Judgment:</strong> At death, each person undergoes the Particular Judgment, receiving their eternal destiny based on their faith and deeds. At the end of time, the General (Last) Judgment will reveal all deeds publicly and unite soul and body for eternity.</p>
        <p><strong>Heaven:</strong> Eternal communion with God, the angels, and saints, where we see God "face to face" and share in His life, joy, and love forever.</p>
        <p><strong>Hell:</strong> Eternal separation from God caused by the free and definitive choice to reject His love and grace. The suffering of hell is primarily the loss of God.</p>
        <p>The Last Four Things help us live with purpose, urgency, and hope, inspiring us to persevere in grace and prepare to meet the Lord with confidence.</p>

    title: "The Church Militant, Suffering, & Triumphant",
    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Church exists in three states: the Church Militant (faithful on earth), the Church Suffering (souls in purgatory being purified), and the Church Triumphant (saints in heaven). Together, they form one communion in Christ, united in prayer and love (CCC 954–959).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ephesians 4:4–5</strong> – "There is one body and one Spirit… one Lord, one faith, one baptism."</li>
            <li><strong>Hebrews 12:1</strong> – "We are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses."</li>
            <li><strong>Revelation 7:9</strong> – A vision of the saints in heaven from every nation, tribe, and tongue.</li>
            <li><strong>2 Maccabees 12:44–45</strong> – Prayer for the dead is good and holy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 954</strong> – The Church is the communion of all the faithful, those in heaven, those being purified, and those on earth.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 955</strong> – Union with the saints joins the Church of heaven and the Church of earth in love and prayer.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 958</strong> – Our prayer for the dead can help them, and their intercession can help us.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 959</strong> – In the one family of God, all share in the same charity and praise of the Trinity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Whether in battle on earth, in purification after death, or in glory before God, all members of the Church remain united in Christ and in love."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Church Militant refers to the faithful on earth who are still on their pilgrimage toward heaven, engaged in the spiritual battle against sin, the world, and the devil. They grow in holiness through prayer, the sacraments, and works of charity.</p>
        <p>The Church Suffering refers to the souls in purgatory, undergoing purification to achieve the holiness necessary to enter heaven. They cannot help themselves but rely on the prayers, sacrifices, and Masses offered by the faithful on earth.</p>
        <p>The Church Triumphant consists of the saints in heaven, who enjoy eternal union with God and intercede for the faithful on earth and in purgatory.</p>
        <p>Together, these three states form one Church, bound by the communion of saints. The unity between them is not broken by death but strengthened by love in Christ.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Second Coming, also called the Parousia, is the future return of Jesus Christ in glory to judge the living and the dead and to establish the fullness of His Kingdom. It will bring the history of the world to its completion and usher in the new heavens and the new earth (CCC 668–682).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matthew 24:30</strong> – "They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."</li>

            <li><strong>Revelation 22:12</strong> – "Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 668</strong> – Christ is already Lord of the universe and will reign fully when He returns.</li>

            <li><strong>CCC 673</strong> – The glorious Messiah’s coming is imminent, though its time is unknown.</li>

        <blockquote>
            "Christ will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and His Kingdom will have no end."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Second Coming of Christ will be the glorious and definitive fulfillment of God’s plan for the world. Unlike His first coming in humility at Bethlehem, the Second Coming will be marked by majesty and power, visible to all people.</p>
        <p>When Christ returns, He will raise the dead, judge all humanity, and bring about the renewal of the heavens and the earth. The righteous will enter eternal life in the fullness of God’s Kingdom, while those who have rejected God will face eternal separation from Him.</p>
        <p>The time of the Second Coming is unknown, and Jesus warns us to "stay awake" and live in readiness, for it will come suddenly, like a thief in the night. In the meantime, the Church continues Christ’s mission, proclaiming the Gospel so that all may be prepared for His return.</p>
        <p>This doctrine inspires hope for believers, as it promises the final victory of God over evil and the completion of salvation history.</p>

    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Eternal life is the blessed communion with the Holy Trinity, the angels, and all the saints, in which we share God's own divine life forever. It begins at baptism, grows through grace in this life, and is perfected in heaven (CCC 1023–1029, 260).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>John 3:16</strong> – "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."</li>
            <li><strong>John 17:3</strong> – "This is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."</li>
            <li><strong>Romans 6:23</strong> – "The free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."</li>
            <li><strong>Revelation 21:4</strong> – "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1023</strong> – Those who die in God's grace and friendship live forever with Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1024</strong> – Heaven is the ultimate end and fulfillment of the deepest human longings.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1027</strong> – Heaven is described as the blessed community of all who are perfectly incorporated into Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1029</strong> – In heaven, we will reign with Christ forever.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 260</strong> – The ultimate goal of creation is that God may be "all in all," sharing His divine life with us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Eternal life is to know and love God forever, sharing in His divine life and joy without end."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Eternal life is not merely endless existence but a life of perfect love, joy, and communion with God. It is the fulfillment of the promise of salvation, where we see God "face to face" and participate in His divine nature.</p>
        <p>This life begins here on earth when we are united to Christ through baptism and grows as we live in His grace. Sin separates us from eternal life, but repentance and God’s mercy restore us to the path of salvation.</p>
        <p>In heaven, there will be no more suffering, death, or separation from God. The blessed will rejoice forever in the beatific vision — the direct contemplation of God in His glory — and will share in the eternal praise of the Trinity.</p>
        <p>Eternal life is the destiny for which every human person was created, and God offers it freely to all who believe in and follow His Son.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Baptism is the first of the seven sacraments and the gateway to the Christian life. It cleanses us from Original Sin, makes us children of God, incorporates us into the Body of Christ, and gives us a share in the divine life (CCC 1213–1284).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Acts 2:38</strong> – "Repent and be baptized… for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."</li>
            <li><strong>Romans 6:3–4</strong> – "We were buried… with him by baptism into death, so that… we too might walk in newness of life."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1213</strong> – Baptism is the gateway to life in the Spirit and the door which gives access to the other sacraments.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1214</strong> – The word "baptism" means "to plunge" or "immerse," signifying burial with Christ and rising with Him.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1263</strong> – By baptism all sins are forgiven, including Original Sin.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1265</strong> – Baptism makes us members of Christ and partakers of the divine nature.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1277</strong> – Baptism is birth into new life in Christ.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Through Baptism we die to sin, are reborn as children of God, and begin our journey of faith in the Body of Christ."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Baptism is the foundational sacrament of Christian initiation. Through it, a person is freed from sin, reborn as a child of God, and incorporated into the Church. This sacrament leaves a permanent spiritual mark, or character, on the soul and cannot be repeated.</p>
        <p>Baptism is ordinarily conferred by pouring water over the head or by immersion, accompanied by the Trinitarian formula: "I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."</p>
        <p>In Baptism, we are united to Christ’s death and resurrection, becoming members of His Body. It is the beginning of a life of grace that is nourished through the other sacraments, especially the Eucharist.</p>
        <p>Because Baptism is necessary for salvation, the Church urges parents to have their children baptized soon after birth, and she recognizes the baptism of those who, though not formally baptized, die with the desire for the sacrament or suffer martyrdom for Christ.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "In Confirmation, the Holy Spirit strengthens us to live our faith boldly and to be witnesses of Christ to the world."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Confirmation deepens the grace first received at Baptism. Through the anointing with sacred chrism and the laying on of hands by a bishop (or delegated priest), the Holy Spirit strengthens the faithful with His gifts, enabling them to live as mature disciples of Christ.</p>
        <p>The sacrament confers the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit — wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord — equipping the Christian for a life of holiness and mission. It also increases the fruits of the Holy Spirit in one’s life.</p>
        <p>Confirmation unites the recipient more closely to Christ and to the Church, strengthens them in the battle against sin, and empowers them to proclaim the Gospel without fear.</p>
        <p>Like Baptism, Confirmation leaves an indelible mark on the soul and can only be received once. It is ordinarily received after the age of reason, following a period of preparation and catechesis.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Holy Eucharist is the sacrament in which Jesus Christ gives us His Body and Blood under the appearances of bread and wine. It is the source and summit of the Christian life, making present the sacrifice of the Cross and uniting us to Christ (CCC 1322–1419).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matthew 26:26–28</strong> – "This is my body… this is my blood… do this in remembrance of me."</li>
            <li><strong>John 6:51</strong> – "I am the living bread that came down from heaven… the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."</li>
            <li><strong>Luke 24:30–31</strong> – The risen Christ is made known in the breaking of the bread.</li>
            <li><strong>1 Corinthians 10:16</strong> – "The cup of blessing… is it not a participation in the blood of Christ?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1324</strong> – The Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian life.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1333</strong> – Bread and wine become the Body and Blood of Christ by the words of Christ and the invocation of the Holy Spirit.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1367</strong> – The Eucharist makes present the one sacrifice of Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1374</strong> – Christ is truly, really, and substantially present in the Eucharist.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1382</strong> – In the Eucharist, the sacrifice of Christ becomes the sacrifice of the Church.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "In the Eucharist, we receive Jesus Himself — the Bread of Life — who nourishes our souls and unites us in His Body."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Eucharist is both a sacrament and a sacrifice. Instituted by Christ at the Last Supper, it is the memorial of His passion, death, and resurrection. Through the consecration at Mass, the bread and wine truly become the Body and Blood of Christ — a change called transubstantiation.</p>
        <p>Receiving the Eucharist strengthens our union with Christ, forgives venial sins, and helps us grow in love for God and neighbor. It deepens our incorporation into the Church and commits us to the poor.</p>
        <p>Because the Eucharist is the source and summit of Christian life, the Church obliges the faithful to participate in Mass every Sunday and holy day of obligation, and to receive Holy Communion at least once a year, during the Easter season.</p>
        <p>To receive the Eucharist worthily, one must be in a state of grace, having confessed mortal sins through the Sacrament of Reconciliation, and should fast for at least one hour before Communion.</p>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Holy Orders was instituted by Christ to ensure that His saving mission would continue throughout history. This sacrament has three degrees: episcopate (bishop), presbyterate (priest), and diaconate (deacon).</p>
        <p>Bishops are successors to the Apostles, entrusted with teaching, sanctifying, and governing the Church. Priests share in the bishop’s ministry, primarily through celebrating the sacraments, preaching, and pastoral care. Deacons assist in service, proclaim the Gospel, and perform works of charity.</p>
        <p>Holy Orders is conferred by the laying on of hands by a validly ordained bishop, along with a consecratory prayer. This confers an indelible spiritual character, meaning the sacrament cannot be repeated.</p>
        <p>Through this sacrament, Christ remains present and active in His Church, guiding her through the apostolic ministry until the end of time.</p>

    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Holy Matrimony is the sacrament in which a baptized man and a baptized woman freely enter into a lifelong covenant of love and fidelity, ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of children. Christ raised marriage to the dignity of a sacrament (CCC 1601–1666).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genesis 2:24</strong> – "A man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 19:6</strong> – "What God has joined together, let no one separate."</li>
            <li><strong>Ephesians 5:25</strong> – "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the Church."</li>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "In Holy Matrimony, the love of husband and wife becomes a living sign of Christ’s love for His Church."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Marriage was part of God’s plan from the beginning, established as a permanent and faithful union between man and woman. In the New Covenant, Christ elevated marriage to a sacrament, giving spouses the grace to love each other with the love with which He loves His Church.</p>
        <p>The essential elements of Christian marriage are unity, indissolubility, and openness to life. The mutual consent of the spouses, expressed freely, is what makes a marriage valid. The sacrament strengthens couples to live out their vows through good times and trials, and to raise their children in the faith.</p>
        <p>Married love mirrors Christ’s love — faithful, fruitful, and self-giving. It is a vocation, a calling to holiness, in which spouses help each other grow in virtue and lead one another toward eternal life.</p>

    title: "Reconciliation",
    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Sacrament of Reconciliation, also called Confession or Penance, is the sacrament in which Christ, through the ministry of the priest, forgives sins committed after Baptism and reconciles the sinner with God and the Church (CCC 1422–1498).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>John 20:22–23</strong> – "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them."</li>
            <li><strong>James 5:16</strong> – "Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed."</li>
            <li><strong>Luke 15:11–32</strong> – The parable of the Prodigal Son.</li>
            <li><strong>2 Corinthians 5:18</strong> – God gave us the ministry of reconciliation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1424</strong> – The sacrament is called Reconciliation because it reconciles the sinner to God and the Church.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1446</strong> – Christ instituted the sacrament for the forgiveness of sins committed after Baptism.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1456</strong> – All mortal sins must be confessed in kind and number.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1468</strong> – Reconciliation restores grace and brings peace to the soul.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1496</strong> – The sacrament reconciles us with God, the Church, and ourselves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "In the Sacrament of Reconciliation, the mercy of Christ meets our repentance, and we are restored to grace and peace."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Reconciliation is the ordinary means by which serious sins committed after Baptism are forgiven. It requires contrition (sorrow for sin), confession (telling sins to a priest), absolution (the priest’s prayer of forgiveness), and satisfaction (penance to repair the harm caused by sin).</p>
        <p>This sacrament reconciles us not only with God but also with the Church, because sin damages the Body of Christ. It strengthens us to resist future temptations and heals spiritual wounds.</p>
        <p>The Church encourages frequent confession, even of venial sins, as a way to grow in holiness. Mortal sin must be confessed before receiving Holy Communion.</p>
        <p>Through the ministry of the priest, acting in the person of Christ, the penitent experiences the embrace of the Father, much like the prodigal son in Jesus’ parable.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Anointing of the Sick is the sacrament in which the Church, through the ministry of the priest, confers special grace on those who are seriously ill, elderly, or near death. It unites the sick person more closely to Christ’s Passion, offers forgiveness of sins, and can restore health if it is God’s will (CCC 1499–1532).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>James 5:14–15</strong> – "Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord."</li>
            <li><strong>Mark 6:13</strong> – The Apostles anoint the sick with oil and heal them.</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 11:28</strong> – "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 41:3</strong> – "The Lord sustains him on his sickbed; in his illness you restore him to full health."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1499</strong> – By the sacred anointing and prayer, the whole Church commends the sick to Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1501</strong> – Illness can make a person feel powerless and abandoned, but it can also lead to deeper union with Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1511</strong> – The Anointing of the Sick is instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1520</strong> – The sacrament gives grace for peace, courage, and strengthening against temptation.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1523</strong> – As “the sacrament of departing,” it prepares the person for the final journey to eternal life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "In the Anointing of the Sick, Christ the Divine Physician brings healing, peace, and strength to those who suffer."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>This sacrament is for those in serious illness, the elderly whose frailty is increasing, or anyone preparing for major surgery. It can be received more than once if the person’s condition changes or worsens.</p>
        <p>The priest anoints the sick person with oil blessed by the bishop, usually on the forehead and hands, while praying for healing and strength. The sacrament forgives sins if the person is unable to go to confession, strengthens them to face suffering with faith, and unites their trials to Christ’s saving Passion.</p>
        <p>While it may bring physical healing, its primary purpose is spiritual — to prepare the soul for eternal life, restore peace, and deepen trust in God’s will.</p>
        <p>When given at the end of life, it is often accompanied by the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (called Viaticum, or “food for the journey”).</p>

            "In the liturgy, heaven and earth meet, and the faithful are drawn into the saving work of Christ."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The liturgy is the heart of the Church’s life. It is the official, public worship offered to God by the Church, through which the faithful share in Christ’s priesthood and the mysteries of salvation.</p>
        <p>The liturgy includes the Mass, the celebration of the sacraments, the Liturgy of the Hours, and other rites and blessings. It is not merely a human action but the work of Christ Himself, made present in the Church by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>In the liturgy, we encounter Christ in multiple ways: in the Eucharist, in the proclamation of the Word, in the person of the minister, and in the gathered assembly. The liturgy is a foretaste of the heavenly worship described in Revelation.</p>
        <p>Active participation in the liturgy is both an obligation and a privilege for the faithful, uniting them with the Church worldwide and throughout history in one voice of praise and thanksgiving to God.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Mass is the central act of Catholic worship, the re-presentation of Christ’s one sacrifice on Calvary, and the sacred banquet in which the faithful receive the Body and Blood of the Lord. It is the source and summit of the Christian life (CCC 1324, 1346–1389).</p>

        <blockquote>
            "At the Mass, heaven touches earth, and Christ’s saving sacrifice is made present for our salvation."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Mass is the heart of the Church’s life and worship. It is at once a memorial, a sacrifice, and a sacred meal. In it, the Church obeys Christ’s command at the Last Supper: "Do this in remembrance of me."</p>
        <p>The Mass has two principal parts: the Liturgy of the Word, in which God speaks to His people through Scripture, and the Liturgy of the Eucharist, in which bread and wine become the Body and Blood of Christ through the prayer of the priest and the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>By participating in the Mass, the faithful unite themselves with Christ’s offering to the Father, receive spiritual nourishment, and are strengthened for the mission of the Gospel. Attendance at Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation is a serious duty for Catholics.</p>
        <p>In the Mass, past, present, and future meet: the sacrifice of the Cross is made present, the Risen Christ is with us, and we anticipate the eternal banquet of heaven.</p>

        <p>The sacramental economy is the communication of the fruits of Christ’s Paschal Mystery through the Church’s liturgy and sacraments. It is the way God dispenses His grace in the New Covenant, uniting us to Christ and sharing in His divine life (CCC 1076–1209).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The sacramental economy refers to the way in which the salvation won by Jesus Christ is made present and effective in the world today. It is the divine plan for dispensing grace through the liturgy and sacraments of the Church.</p>
        <p>Rooted in the Paschal Mystery — Christ’s Passion, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension — the sacramental economy ensures that every generation can personally encounter and receive the fruits of redemption.</p>
        <p>In this economy, Christ acts through the Church by the power of the Holy Spirit. The sacraments are not mere symbols but real channels of divine grace, transforming and sanctifying those who receive them with faith.</p>
        <p>From Baptism to the Eucharist, from Reconciliation to Anointing of the Sick, each sacrament is part of God’s plan to draw humanity into His life, forming the Church as the Body of Christ until the end of time.</p>

    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Sacramentals are sacred signs instituted by the Church to prepare us to receive grace and to sanctify different circumstances of life. They are not sacraments themselves but help dispose us to receive the grace of the sacraments and grow in holiness (CCC 1667–1679).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Numbers 5:17</strong> – The use of holy water in purification rites.</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 9:20–22</strong> – A woman is healed by touching the hem of Jesus’ garment.</li>
            <li><strong>Acts 19:11–12</strong> – Handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched Paul healed the sick.</li>
            <li><strong>2 Kings 13:21</strong> – A man revived after touching the bones of Elisha.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1667</strong> – Sacramentals are sacred signs instituted by the Church.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1668</strong> – They prepare us to receive grace and dispose us to cooperate with it.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1670</strong> – They signify effects obtained through the Church’s intercession.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1671</strong> – Includes blessings, consecrations, and exorcisms.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1679</strong> – Popular piety, such as the Rosary and pilgrimages, supports the liturgical life of the Church.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Through sacramentals, the Church blesses our lives, setting apart persons, places, and things for God’s glory."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Sacramentals are instituted by the Church to sanctify various aspects of daily life. Unlike the sacraments, which were instituted by Christ and confer grace ex opere operato (by the very act of the sacrament being performed), sacramentals work ex opere operantis — according to the disposition of the person receiving them and the prayers of the Church.</p>
        <p>Examples of sacramentals include blessings (of people, meals, or objects), holy water, crucifixes, medals, scapulars, the sign of the cross, and devotional practices such as the Rosary. They also include exorcisms and consecrations.</p>
        <p>The purpose of sacramentals is to help the faithful grow in faith, turn their minds to God, and live in continual awareness of His presence. They prepare us to better receive the sacraments and to live our baptismal calling in everyday life.</p>
        <p>While they do not confer sanctifying grace in the same way the sacraments do, they bring actual graces, blessings, and protection when used with faith.</p>

    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Morality refers to the principles and standards by which we determine whether actions are good or evil, right or wrong, in light of God’s truth and human dignity. Christian morality is rooted in God’s law, revealed in Scripture, and fulfilled in Christ (CCC 1749–1802).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Micah 6:8</strong> – "What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?"</li>
            <li><strong>John 14:15</strong> – "If you love me, you will keep my commandments."</li>
            <li><strong>Romans 12:2</strong> – "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind."</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 22:37–39</strong> – The two great commandments: love of God and love of neighbor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1749</strong> – Freedom makes man a moral subject.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1750</strong> – The morality of acts depends on the object, the intention, and the circumstances.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1776</strong> – Deep within his conscience, man discovers a law written by God.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1780</strong> – The dignity of the human person requires upright moral conscience.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1800</strong> – A person must always obey the certain judgment of his conscience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "True morality is not about rules alone, but about living in loving relationship with God and neighbor."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Morality is the standard by which we measure human acts in light of God’s will. For Christians, morality flows from our identity as children of God, made in His image and redeemed by Christ.</p>
        <p>Christian morality is based on divine law: the moral law given in the Ten Commandments, perfected by the New Law of the Gospel. It is not arbitrary, but rooted in the truth of who God is and who we are called to be.</p>
        <p>Every human action has a moral dimension, determined by the object (what is done), the intention (why it is done), and the circumstances (the context). An action is morally good only if all three elements are good.</p>
        <p>Morality is ultimately about love: love of God and love of neighbor. This love guides our conscience and helps us choose what is truly good, leading to holiness and eternal life.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Human dignity is the intrinsic worth of every person, rooted in the fact that we are created in the image and likeness of God and called to share in His divine life. This dignity is inherent, inalienable, and the foundation for all moral teaching (CCC 1700–1715).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genesis 1:27</strong> – "God created man in His own image… male and female He created them."</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1700</strong> – The dignity of the human person is rooted in creation in God’s image and fulfilled in our vocation to divine beatitude.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1702</strong> – The divine image is present in every person.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1706</strong> – By reason, man recognizes the voice of God urging him to do good and avoid evil.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1711</strong> – Endowed with a spiritual soul, intellect, and free will, every person has the dignity of a person.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1929</strong> – Justice and charity require respect for the rights of the human person.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Every human life, from conception to natural death, is sacred and possesses an inviolable dignity given by God."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Human dignity is not earned by achievements, status, or abilities — it is given by God at the moment of creation. Because we are made in His image, every human being, without exception, has equal worth and is worthy of respect.</p>
        <p>This dignity forms the basis of Catholic moral teaching on life issues, justice, and charity. It demands that we treat others not as objects or means to an end but as persons with inherent value.</p>
        <p>Human dignity is fully realized when we live according to God’s plan, choosing what is good and rejecting what is evil. Sin wounds human dignity, but Christ restores it through His grace and redemption.</p>
        <p>Respecting human dignity means defending the most vulnerable, promoting the common good, and fostering a culture of life and love in our homes, communities, and the world.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Freedom is the God-given power to act or not to act, to choose good or evil, and to shape one’s own life. True freedom is ordered toward the good and finds its fulfillment in choosing what is right according to God’s will (CCC 1730–1748).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Galatians 5:13</strong> – "For you were called to freedom… only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another."</li>
            <li><strong>Deuteronomy 30:19</strong> – "I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life."</li>
            <li><strong>John 8:32</strong> – "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."</li>
            <li><strong>1 Peter 2:16</strong> – "Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1730</strong> – God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1731</strong> – Freedom is the power to act or not to act, and to perform deliberate actions on one’s own responsibility.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1733</strong> – The more one does what is good, the freer one becomes.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1740</strong> – The exercise of freedom does not imply a right to say or do anything.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1747</strong> – Freedom is exercised in relationships between human beings and is always ordered toward the good.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Freedom is not the license to do whatever we want, but the power to do what we ought."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Freedom is one of God’s greatest gifts to humanity, allowing us to choose and to love. However, freedom is not absolute independence from all authority — it is meant to be exercised within the moral order given by God.</p>
        <p>Every choice we make shapes our character and directs our lives either toward God or away from Him. Choosing what is good, true, and loving increases our freedom, while choosing evil leads to sin and slavery to vice.</p>
        <p>True freedom is not found in rejecting God’s law but in living it fully. By knowing the truth revealed by God, we can make choices that lead to lasting joy and fulfillment.</p>
        <p>Freedom also carries responsibility. We are accountable for our actions and their effects on ourselves and others. This means our choices must always respect the dignity of every human person and promote the common good.</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>

            <li><strong>Romans 2:14–15</strong> – "They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness."</li>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Natural law is part of God’s eternal law and is imprinted on the nature of every human being. It is accessible to human reason and does not depend on religious belief to be understood. This is why it serves as the foundation for universal moral principles and human rights.</p>
        <p>Through natural law, every person is capable of recognizing fundamental moral truths, such as the obligation to do good, avoid evil, respect life, and honor commitments. These principles are present in the conscience of every human being.</p>
        <p>While sin and cultural influences can obscure our understanding of natural law, it remains binding on all people. Revelation in Scripture and the teaching of the Church help clarify its meaning and application in complex situations.</p>
        <p>Living according to natural law fosters justice, peace, and the flourishing of human communities, because it aligns human behavior with God’s design for creation.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Conscience is not merely personal opinion or feeling — it is a judgment of reason that evaluates whether a chosen action is good or evil. It reflects the natural law written by God in our hearts, confirmed by divine revelation.</p>
        <p>Forming a good conscience requires seeking the truth and allowing it to shape our decisions. This involves prayer, studying Scripture and Church teaching, and seeking wise counsel. An uninformed or misinformed conscience can lead us into moral error.</p>
        <p>We have a moral duty to follow our conscience, but also to form it correctly. Obedience to a well-formed conscience leads to freedom and holiness, while ignoring it can lead to sin and moral blindness.</p>
        <p>Conscience is active before we act (prompting us to choose good), during the act (guiding us), and after the act (approving what is good or warning us when we have done wrong).</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Ten Commandments are God’s moral law given to Moses on Mount Sinai, expressing fundamental obligations toward God and neighbor. They remain a central guide for Christian moral life, fulfilled and deepened in Christ’s New Law of love (CCC 2052–2557).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exodus 20:1–17</strong> – The Ten Commandments given to Moses.</li>
            <li><strong>Deuteronomy 5:6–21</strong> – The covenant renewed with Israel.</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 22:37–40</strong> – Jesus sums up the Law in love of God and neighbor.</li>
            <li><strong>Romans 13:9–10</strong> – "Love is the fulfilling of the law."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 2055</strong> – The Ten Commandments must be understood in light of the twofold commandment of love.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2068</strong> – The Commandments are obligatory for all and teach the essential duties of man.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2072</strong> – Since they express fundamental duties, they are immutable.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2083</strong> – The first three commandments concern love of God; the other seven, love of neighbor.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2135</strong> – The first commandment calls for faith, hope, and charity toward God.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The Ten Commandments reveal God’s will for our lives, guiding us to love Him above all and our neighbor as ourselves."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Ten Commandments, also called the Decalogue, were given by God to Moses as part of the covenant with Israel. They are not merely ancient laws but enduring expressions of the moral law written on every human heart.</p>
        <p>The Commandments are divided into two tablets: the first three direct our relationship with God (no other gods, reverence for His name, keeping the Lord’s Day holy), and the remaining seven govern our relationship with others (honor parents, respect life, uphold chastity, respect property, speak truth, and avoid coveting).</p>
        <p>In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills the Commandments by summarizing them into the law of love: love of God with all our heart, soul, and mind, and love of neighbor as ourselves.</p>
        <p>For Christians, the Ten Commandments remain essential moral guidelines, illuminating what is good, identifying sin, and leading us to holiness through God’s grace.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The First Commandment — "You shall have no other gods before Me" — calls us to worship God alone, avoiding idolatry, superstition, or placing anything above God in our lives. It is a command to faith, hope, and love toward God.</p>
        <p>The Second Commandment — "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain" — requires reverence for God’s name and all holy things. This means avoiding blasphemy, false oaths, and using God’s name carelessly.</p>
        <p>The Third Commandment — "Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day" — commands us to set aside one day for rest and worship. For Christians, this is Sunday, the day of the Resurrection, and includes attending Mass, avoiding unnecessary work, and dedicating time to family and charity.</p>
        <p>These commandments help us live our relationship with God authentically, shaping our worship, words, and use of time to reflect His holiness.</p>

    title: "Freedom in Christ",
    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Freedom in Christ is the liberation from the slavery of sin and the ability to live fully as children of God, guided by the Holy Spirit. It is not the license to do whatever we want, but the grace-filled power to choose the good, live in truth, and love as Christ loves (CCC 1730–1748, 1748–1756).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>John 8:36</strong> – "If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."</li>
            <li><strong>Galatians 5:1</strong> – "For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery."</li>
            <li><strong>2 Corinthians 3:17</strong> – "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."</li>
            <li><strong>Romans 6:22</strong> – "Now that you have been freed from sin and have become slaves of God, the advantage you get is sanctification and the end is eternal life."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1731</strong> – Freedom is the power to act or not to act, and to perform deliberate actions on one’s own responsibility.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1733</strong> – The more one does what is good, the freer one becomes.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1740</strong> – Freedom is not an absolute right to do anything but is ordered toward the good.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1748</strong> – In Christ, human beings have been set free for true freedom.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1749</strong> – Freedom makes man responsible for his acts to the extent that they are voluntary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "True freedom is found not in doing whatever we please, but in living as God created us to live — in truth, love, and holiness."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Freedom in Christ is a transformation of the will and heart. Before Christ, humanity was enslaved by sin and unable to live fully according to God’s plan. Through His death and resurrection, Christ breaks the chains of sin and gives us the grace to live in righteousness.</p>
        <p>This freedom is not independence from God but dependence on Him in love. It is freedom for virtue, service, and love of neighbor. When guided by the Holy Spirit, our choices lead to holiness and eternal life.</p>
        <p>Christian freedom includes both rights and responsibilities: the right to live in the truth of the Gospel and the responsibility to use our freedom for good, not for selfish purposes. As St. Paul teaches, freedom must be exercised in service to others.</p>
        <p>To live in the freedom of Christ means to reject the slavery of sin, to embrace God’s will, and to live joyfully in the hope of eternal life.</p>

            "We are saved by God’s grace, justified in Christ, and called to bear fruit worthy of eternal life."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p><strong>Grace</strong> is the divine life of God shared with us. It comes in two main forms: sanctifying grace (which makes us holy and a child of God) and actual grace (God’s help in particular situations). Grace is always God’s initiative — we cannot earn it — but we can accept or reject it.</p>
        <p><strong>Justification</strong> is God’s work of forgiving our sins, making us righteous, and restoring us to friendship with Him. It is accomplished by Christ’s sacrifice and received through faith and the sacraments, especially Baptism.</p>
        <p><strong>Merit</strong> refers to the reward God promises for good works done in grace. While we cannot earn salvation itself, God in His goodness allows our cooperation with grace to have eternal value.</p>
        <p>These three concepts are deeply connected: grace initiates and sustains our relationship with God, justification establishes us in righteousness, and merit crowns our cooperation with the work of grace in our lives.</p>

    title: "The Beatitudes",
    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Beatitudes are the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount that reveal the attitudes and virtues of those who are blessed in the Kingdom of God. They are both promises of eternal happiness and guides for living a life conformed to Christ (CCC 1716–1729).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matthew 5:3–12</strong> – The Beatitudes as taught by Jesus.</li>
            <li><strong>Luke 6:20–23</strong> – The Beatitudes in Luke’s Gospel.</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 1:1–2</strong> – "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked… but his delight is in the law of the Lord."</li>
            <li><strong>Romans 12:12</strong> – "Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1716</strong> – The Beatitudes are at the heart of Jesus’ preaching.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1717</strong> – They depict the countenance of Jesus Christ and describe His charity.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1719</strong> – The Beatitudes point to the goal of human existence: eternal happiness with God.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1723</strong> – True happiness is found in God alone.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1726</strong> – The Beatitudes fulfill the promises by ordering them to the Kingdom of Heaven.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The Beatitudes show us the face of Christ and the path to the joy of His Kingdom."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Beatitudes, found in Matthew 5:3–12, are eight blessings that describe the heart and life of a true disciple. Each Beatitude presents a paradox: what seems like weakness or loss in the world’s eyes is actually a path to true happiness in God’s Kingdom.</p>
        <p>They are not merely commands but invitations to share in the very life and mission of Christ. Living the Beatitudes shapes us into the likeness of Jesus, who embodies each one perfectly.</p>
        <p>The Beatitudes also reveal that holiness is more than keeping rules — it is a transformation of the heart. They reorient our values from earthly success to heavenly reward.</p>
        <p>By living the Beatitudes, we begin to experience the joy of the Kingdom now, even amid trials, and we are promised its fullness in eternity.</p>

        <h4>The Eight Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3–12)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</li>
            <li>Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</li>
            <li>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</li>
            <li>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</li>
            <li>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</li>
            <li>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</li>
            <li>Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</li>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Virtues are habitual and firm dispositions to do the good. They enable us to live morally and grow in holiness. Vices are habitual dispositions to do evil, weakening our moral character and leading us away from God (CCC 1803–1869).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philippians 4:8</strong> – "Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure… think about these things."</li>

            <li><strong>Romans 12:21</strong> – "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."</li>
            <li><strong>Proverbs 4:23</strong> – "Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1803</strong> – A virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1804</strong> – Human virtues are acquired by human effort and purified by divine grace.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1805</strong> – The four cardinal virtues are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1810</strong> – Moral virtues grow through education, deliberate acts, and perseverance.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1865</strong> – Sin creates a proclivity to sin; repetition of sins engenders vices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Virtue strengthens the soul to choose the good; vice enslaves the soul to evil."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Virtues are good habits that shape our character toward moral excellence. They are either human virtues (developed through practice and grace) or theological virtues (faith, hope, and charity, given directly by God).</p>
        <p>The four cardinal virtues — prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance — are foundational for living a good moral life. The theological virtues — faith, hope, and charity — orient us directly toward God.</p>
        <p>Vices are the opposite: bad habits or dispositions that incline us to sin. They can be personal sins that become ingrained or capital vices such as pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth.</p>
        <p>Virtue is built by repeated good actions and strengthened by God’s grace, while vice is formed by repeated sin. The Christian moral life calls us to identify and uproot vice, replacing it with the practice of virtue.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>A habit is a stable quality of mind and will that inclines a person to act in a certain way. Good habits (virtues) make it easier to do what is right, while bad habits (vices) make it easier to do what is wrong. Habits are formed through repeated actions and can be strengthened or weakened over time (CCC 1803–1869).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>

            <li><strong>1 Corinthians 9:25</strong> – "Every athlete exercises self-control in all things."</li>
            <li><strong>Proverbs 22:6</strong> – "Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1804</strong> – Human virtues are firm attitudes, stable dispositions, and habitual perfections of intellect and will.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1810</strong> – Moral virtues grow through education, deliberate acts, and perseverance in struggle.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1865</strong> – Repeated sins engender vices, which corrupt conscience and incline us to sin.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1889</strong> – Charity is the form of all virtues and sustains moral living.</li>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "We become what we repeatedly do; therefore, let our habits be rooted in love, truth, and virtue."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Habits shape our character and influence our future choices. Good habits, or virtues, are developed by consistently choosing what is good and right. Over time, these choices become second nature, making it easier to live in harmony with God’s will.</p>
        <p>Bad habits, or vices, are formed when we repeatedly choose sin. These habits weaken the will, distort judgment, and make it harder to choose the good. They can be broken through God’s grace, repentance, and the cultivation of opposite virtues.</p>
        <p>Habits are not formed overnight. They require patience, self-discipline, and intentional practice. Prayer, the sacraments, and living the moral law strengthen good habits and help us persevere.</p>
        <p>Because habits direct our daily life, forming holy habits is essential for growing in holiness and becoming more like Christ.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and all that He has revealed, and which the Church proposes for belief. It is both a gift from God and a human act of trust, obedience, and commitment to Him (CCC 153–165, 1814–1816).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hebrews 11:1</strong> – "Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."</li>
            <li><strong>Romans 10:17</strong> – "Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ."</li>
            <li><strong>Mark 9:24</strong> – "I believe; help my unbelief!"</li>
            <li><strong>Ephesians 2:8</strong> – "By grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 153</strong> – Faith is a gift of God, a supernatural virtue infused by Him.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 154</strong> – Faith is a human act; it is trusting God and submitting our intellect and will to Him.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 156</strong> – The motives of credibility show that faith is not opposed to reason.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1814</strong> – Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and all He has said and revealed.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1816</strong> – Faith without works is dead; believers must profess and live their faith.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Faith is both God’s gift and our response — a living relationship of trust and obedience to Him."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Faith is more than simply agreeing with religious truths; it is a personal relationship with God built on trust in His love and promises. It begins as a gift from God through grace, but it must be freely accepted and lived out in daily life.</p>
        <p>Faith involves the whole person — mind, will, and heart. We believe because God is truth itself and cannot deceive. Faith opens the door to understanding God’s plan and shapes how we live, leading us to love and serve Him and our neighbor.</p>
        <p>The Church teaches that faith must be nourished through prayer, the sacraments, Scripture, and the teaching of the Church. Faith grows stronger when it is lived in works of charity and witness to the Gospel.</p>
        <p>Like a seed, faith must be cultivated or it will wither. Temptations, doubts, and trials can test faith, but through perseverance, it becomes stronger and leads us to eternal life with God.</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>

        <p>Hope is more than wishful thinking — it is confident trust in God’s faithfulness to His promises. Rooted in Christ’s resurrection, it sustains us through trials, strengthens perseverance, and keeps our hearts oriented toward eternal life.</p>
        <p>Hope enables us to face suffering and uncertainty with courage, knowing that God works all things for the good of those who love Him. It also prevents despair (losing trust in God’s mercy) and presumption (assuming salvation without conversion).</p>
        <p>Christian hope is lived in prayer, the sacraments, acts of charity, and patient endurance in doing good. It transforms the way we live now, giving us joy and confidence as we journey toward our heavenly home.</p>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Charity is the highest virtue because it unites us directly to God, who is Love itself. It is more than feelings of affection; it is a deliberate choice to will the good of another for God’s sake. Charity begins with loving God above all else and extends to loving others as God loves them.</p>
        <p>This virtue is infused into the soul by God and is nourished through prayer, the sacraments, and acts of service. Charity shapes all other virtues, giving them life and purpose.</p>
        <p>Charity is expressed in self-giving, forgiveness, and sacrifice. It imitates Christ’s own love, especially in His passion and death. Without charity, even the most impressive works are empty (cf. 1 Corinthians 13).</p>
        <p>The practice of charity transforms the heart, makes us more like Christ, and is the sure path to holiness and eternal life.</p>

    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The cardinal virtues — prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance — are the four principal moral virtues that all other human virtues hinge upon. They guide our actions, govern our passions, and direct our conduct according to reason and faith (CCC 1805–1809).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wisdom 8:7</strong> – "If one loves righteousness, her labors are virtues; for she teaches self-control and prudence, justice and courage."</li>
            <li><strong>Philippians 4:8–9</strong> – "Whatever is true… just… pure… excellent… think about these things."</li>
            <li><strong>Micah 6:8</strong> – "Do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God."</li>
            <li><strong>1 Corinthians 9:25</strong> – "Every athlete exercises self-control in all things."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1805</strong> – The four cardinal virtues are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1806</strong> – Prudence disposes practical reason to discern our true good and choose the right means to achieve it.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1807</strong> – Justice consists in the firm and constant will to give God and neighbor their due.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1808</strong> – Fortitude ensures firmness in difficulties and constancy in the pursuit of the good.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1809</strong> – Temperance moderates the attraction of pleasures and provides balance in the use of created goods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The cardinal virtues are the foundation of the moral life, enabling us to live with wisdom, integrity, courage, and self-control."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The cardinal virtues are called "cardinal" (from the Latin <em>cardo</em>, meaning "hinge") because they are the hinges upon which the moral life turns. All other human virtues depend on these four.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prudence</strong> – The "charioteer" of the virtues, guiding our decisions by reason and moral truth.</li>
            <li><strong>Justice</strong> – Giving each person, including God, what is due to them in fairness and love.</li>
            <li><strong>Fortitude</strong> – The courage to remain firm in pursuing the good, even in the face of danger or suffering.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperance</strong> – The self-control to moderate desires and pleasures, keeping them in balance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These virtues can be acquired by human effort and are strengthened by God’s grace. They are necessary for personal growth, healthy relationships, and a just society.</p>
        <p>Living the cardinal virtues forms our moral character and prepares us to receive and live the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity to their fullest.</p>

    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Sin is an offense against God and a rejection of His love. Mortal sin destroys the life of grace in the soul, while venial sin wounds it. Capital sins are the root vices from which other sins arise. Lesser sins are those that do not break our relationship with God but still damage it (CCC 1846–1876).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 John 5:16–17</strong> – "There is sin which is mortal… All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin which is not mortal."</li>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1849</strong> – Sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is failure in genuine love for God and neighbor.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1854</strong> – Sins are evaluated according to their gravity: mortal or venial.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1855</strong> – Mortal sin destroys charity; venial sin allows it to remain but offends and wounds it.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1857</strong> – Mortal sin requires grave matter, full knowledge, and deliberate consent.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1866</strong> – The capital sins are pride, greed, envy, wrath, lust, gluttony, and sloth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Sin divides us from God, but His mercy is greater — through repentance and grace we are restored to life."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p><strong>Mortal sin</strong> is a grave violation of God’s law that destroys the divine life (sanctifying grace) in the soul. For a sin to be mortal, three conditions must be met: the act must be of grave matter, committed with full knowledge, and with deliberate consent. Mortal sin, if unrepented, leads to eternal separation from God.</p>
        <p><strong>Venial sin</strong> is a lesser offense against God’s law that wounds charity but does not break our relationship with God. Venial sins dispose us little by little toward greater sin if left unchecked.</p>
        <p><strong>Capital sins</strong> are the root causes of many other sins and inclinations to sin. These include: pride, greed, envy, wrath, lust, gluttony, and sloth. They are called "capital" because they give rise to other sins and vices.</p>
        <p><strong>Lesser sins</strong> refer to venial sins and minor faults, which, while not destroying grace, can weaken the soul and make it more vulnerable to serious sin.</p>
        <p>Christ calls us to continual conversion, rooting out both mortal and venial sin through prayer, examination of conscience, the sacraments, and the cultivation of virtue.</p>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Catholic Social Teaching calls us to see Christ in every person and to work for a world where human dignity is upheld and the common good is served."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Catholic Social Teaching emerges from the Church’s reflection on the Gospel in light of human experience. It is a call to live the love of Christ in public life and to transform society in justice and charity.</p>
        <p>The key principles of CST include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Life and Dignity of the Human Person</strong> – Every human being is created in the image of God and must be respected from conception to natural death.</li>
            <li><strong>Call to Family, Community, and Participation</strong> – The family is the basic unit of society, and all are called to participate in the common good.</li>
            <li><strong>Rights and Responsibilities</strong> – Human rights come with the responsibility to protect the rights of others.</li>
            <li><strong>Option for the Poor and Vulnerable</strong> – We must prioritize the needs of the poor and marginalized.</li>
            <li><strong>Dignity of Work and Rights of Workers</strong> – Work is a form of participation in God’s creation, and workers deserve just wages and safe conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Solidarity</strong> – We are one human family, called to pursue peace and justice together.</li>
            <li><strong>Care for God’s Creation</strong> – We are stewards of the earth, responsible for protecting it for future generations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CST is not optional for Catholics — it is an essential expression of our faith in action. It applies to personal life, parish life, politics, economics, and global relations.</p>

    title: "Mercy and Justice",
    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Justice is the moral virtue that gives God and neighbor their due. Mercy is the loving compassion that goes beyond justice, offering forgiveness, relief, and help even when it is not strictly owed (CCC 1807, 2447).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Micah 6:8</strong> – "Do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God."</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 23:23</strong> – Jesus teaches that justice, mercy, and faithfulness are weightier matters of the law.</li>
            <li><strong>James 2:13</strong> – "Mercy triumphs over judgment."</li>
            <li><strong>Luke 6:36</strong> – "Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 1807</strong> – Justice consists in the firm and constant will to give their due to God and neighbor.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 1931</strong> – Respect for the human person demands the recognition of human rights and duties.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2447</strong> – Works of mercy are charitable actions by which we help our neighbor in body and soul.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2840</strong> – Forgiveness is a high point of Christian prayer, a witness to mercy.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2448</strong> – In its various forms, mercy is expressed especially toward the poor and suffering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Justice gives each their due; mercy gives beyond what is due — for God’s mercy overflows where justice ends."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Justice and mercy are not opposed but work together in God’s plan. Justice ensures fairness, order, and the right relationships between persons and with God. Mercy perfects justice by offering love, forgiveness, and help to those in need.</p>
        <p>In human society, justice sets the standard for what is owed; mercy moves us to go beyond that standard in love. Jesus embodies both perfectly — fulfilling the demands of justice through His sacrifice while pouring out mercy on sinners.</p>
        <p>The Christian is called to live both virtues: to uphold justice in all dealings and to practice mercy in forgiving offenses, aiding the suffering, and showing compassion without discrimination.</p>
        <p>Mercy without justice can enable wrongdoing; justice without mercy can become harsh and unforgiving. Together, they reflect the fullness of God’s love and call us to restore both right relationships and hearts.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Prayer is the raising of one’s mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from Him. It is the living relationship of the children of God with their Father, with His Son Jesus Christ, and with the Holy Spirit (CCC 2559–2565).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philippians 4:6</strong> – "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God."</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 6:6</strong> – "When you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret."</li>
            <li><strong>Luke 11:1</strong> – "Lord, teach us to pray."</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 145:18</strong> – "The Lord is near to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 2559</strong> – Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2560</strong> – God thirsts that we may thirst for Him.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2564</strong> – Christian prayer is a covenant relationship between God and man in Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2565</strong> – Prayer is the living relationship of the children of God with the Holy Trinity.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2590</strong> – The prayer of the Church unites us with Christ’s own prayer to the Father.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Prayer is the heartbeat of the Christian life — our continual conversation with the God who loves us."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Prayer is more than speaking words to God; it is communion with Him. It is an expression of love, trust, and dependence on our Creator. Through prayer, we adore God, confess our sins, express gratitude, and bring our needs before Him.</p>
        <p>Christian prayer takes many forms: vocal prayer, meditation, and contemplation. Each deepens our relationship with God in a unique way.</p>
        <p>Prayer is both a personal and communal act. Personally, it is our one-on-one time with the Lord; communally, it unites us with the Church in worship, especially in the liturgy.</p>
        <p>God initiates the desire for prayer, and we respond. This dialogue changes us, conforms us to His will, and draws us into His life of grace. Prayer is essential for spiritual growth, discernment, and perseverance in faith.</p>

    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Lord’s Prayer, taught by Jesus Himself, is the perfect model of Christian prayer. It sums up the Gospel, expresses our relationship with God, and teaches us how to pray with trust, humility, and love (CCC 2759–2865).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matthew 6:9–13</strong> – Jesus teaches the Lord’s Prayer in the Sermon on the Mount.</li>
            <li><strong>Luke 11:2–4</strong> – The Lord’s Prayer given in response to the disciples’ request, “Lord, teach us to pray.”</li>
            <li><strong>Romans 8:15</strong> – "You have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, ‘Abba! Father!’"</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 103:13</strong> – "As a father has compassion for his children, so the Lord has compassion for those who fear him."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 2759</strong> – The Lord’s Prayer is the summary of the whole Gospel.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2761</strong> – It is truly the prayer of the Church, given by the Lord to His disciples.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2777</strong> – Calling God “Father” expresses a childlike relationship with Him.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2822</strong> – The Father’s will is that “all men be saved” and come to the knowledge of the truth.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2845</strong> – Forgiveness is at the heart of Christian prayer, modeled in the Lord’s Prayer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "When we pray the Lord’s Prayer, we speak with the very words of Jesus, uniting our hearts to His."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Lord’s Prayer is unique because it comes directly from Jesus, who commands, “Pray then like this.” It begins with adoration, calling God our Father, acknowledging His holiness, and desiring His Kingdom.</p>
        <p>It then turns to petitions: for God’s will to be done, for our daily bread, for forgiveness of sins, and for deliverance from evil. These petitions teach us dependence on God for both spiritual and material needs.</p>
        <p>Each phrase is rich in meaning:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Our Father</strong> – We are God’s children, united as one family.</li>
                <li><strong>Hallowed be Thy name</strong> – We praise and honor God’s holiness.</li>
                <li><strong>Thy kingdom come</strong> – We long for God’s reign of justice, peace, and love.</li>
                <li><strong>Thy will be done</strong> – We submit to God’s plan with trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Give us this day our daily bread</strong> – We ask for all that we need, especially the Eucharist.</li>
                <li><strong>Forgive us our trespasses</strong> – We seek mercy and extend it to others.</li>
                <li><strong>Lead us not into temptation</strong> – We ask for protection from sin.</li>
                <li><strong>Deliver us from evil</strong> – We pray for victory over Satan and all harm.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The Lord’s Prayer is both a personal and communal prayer, expressing our trust in God and our unity with the whole Church.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Prayer takes many forms, but all true prayer leads us into the heart of God."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Prayer in the Catholic tradition is rich and diverse. It can be expressed in different ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vocal Prayer</strong> – Spoken aloud or silently, using set prayers or spontaneous words.</li>
            <li><strong>Meditation</strong> – Reflecting deeply on God’s Word, truths of the faith, or His works.</li>
            <li><strong>Contemplation</strong> – Silent, loving presence before God, beyond words.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Church also recognizes traditional types of prayer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adoration</strong> – Worship and praise of God for His greatness and holiness.</li>
            <li><strong>Contrition</strong> – Sorrow for sin and the desire for God’s mercy.</li>
            <li><strong>Thanksgiving</strong> – Gratitude for God’s blessings and grace.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Prayer can be personal or communal, liturgical or private, spontaneous or formal. The important thing is that it is sincere, rooted in faith, and open to the movement of the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>By practicing various forms and types of prayer, we grow in relationship with God and learn to live in His presence at all times.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The Mass is the highest form of prayer in the Catholic Church, the source and summit of the Christian life. In it, the faithful unite themselves with Christ’s perfect offering to the Father through the power of the Holy Spirit (CCC 1324, 1325, 1348–1355).</p>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "In the Mass, heaven touches earth, and we are drawn into the eternal prayer of Christ to the Father."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Mass is the Church’s greatest prayer because it is Christ’s own sacrifice made present for us. It is both a memorial of His passion, death, and resurrection, and a real participation in that sacrifice.</p>
        <p>The structure of the Mass includes:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Introductory Rites</strong> – Gathering, penitential act, and opening prayer.</li>
                <li><strong>Liturgy of the Word</strong> – Readings from Scripture, homily, Creed, and intercessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Liturgy of the Eucharist</strong> – Presentation of gifts, Eucharistic Prayer, and consecration.</li>
                <li><strong>Communion Rite</strong> – The Lord’s Prayer, sign of peace, and reception of Holy Communion.</li>
                <li><strong>Concluding Rites</strong> – Blessing and dismissal.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>In the Mass, the faithful join in Christ’s eternal offering to the Father, uniting their prayers, works, joys, and sufferings with His perfect sacrifice. Participation in the Mass is both a duty and a privilege for Catholics, nourishing us with God’s Word and the Eucharist.</p>
        <p>The Mass is not simply a ritual but an encounter with the living God. Through it, we are transformed, strengthened in grace, and sent forth to live the Gospel in the world.</p>

    title: "Prayer Without Ceasing",
    content: `
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Prayer without ceasing is the continual orientation of our hearts toward God, living in His presence at all times, and offering every moment as an act of love and communion with Him (CCC 2565, 2742–2745).</p>

        <h3>Scriptural References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:16–18</strong> – "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances."</li>
            <li><strong>Colossians 4:2</strong> – "Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving."</li>
            <li><strong>Romans 12:12</strong> – "Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer."</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 16:8</strong> – "I keep the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Catechism References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CCC 2565</strong> – Prayer is the living relationship of the children of God with the Holy Trinity.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2742</strong> – "Pray constantly" is not limited to vocal prayer but is a habit of being in the presence of God.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2743</strong> – Prayer and Christian life are inseparable; it is always possible to pray.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2744</strong> – Prayer is a vital necessity; if we do not pray, we risk spiritual death.</li>
            <li><strong>CCC 2745</strong> – Prayer animates the whole of the Christian life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proclamation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "To pray without ceasing is to live every moment in the awareness of God’s love and to respond with love."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Praying without ceasing does not mean speaking prayers every moment, but living in a constant state of union with God. It is an attitude of the heart that keeps us mindful of His presence in all we do.</p>
        <p>This continuous prayer is nourished by regular times of formal prayer and flows into daily life — in work, rest, relationships, and even struggles. Every action, when offered to God in love, becomes prayer.</p>
        <p>Saints throughout history, such as St. Paul, the Desert Fathers, and St. Thérèse of Lisieux, lived this way, showing that every moment can be sanctified.</p>
        <p>Practicing prayer without ceasing includes: frequent short prayers (aspirations), the habit of thanksgiving, turning to God in every decision, and offering up joys and sufferings for His glory.</p>
        <p>This way of life transforms ordinary days into a continuous act of worship and prepares us for eternal communion with God in heaven.</p>

And he came to her and said, “Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you!” But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.” And Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I have no husband?” And the angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God. And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing will be impossible.” And Mary said, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her."},

And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfilment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.” And Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name. And his mercy is on those who fear him"},

                scripture: "Luke 2:1-20\n\nIn those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. This was the first enrollment, when Quirin′ius was governor of Syria. And all went to be enrolled, each to his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. And she gave birth to her first-born son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn. And in that region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly frightened. And the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of a great joy which will come to all the people; for to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!” When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” And they went with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they saw it, they made known the saying which had been told them concerning this child; and all who heard him wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them."},

And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And inspired by the Spirit he came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, “Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to thy people Israel.” And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phan′uel, of the tribe of Asher; she was of great age, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity, and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem."},

And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom; and when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, but supposing him to be in the company they traveled a day's journey, and then sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances; and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions; and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when they saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I and I have been looking for you anxiously.” And he said to them, “How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?” And they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them. He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them; and his mother kept all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and man."}
